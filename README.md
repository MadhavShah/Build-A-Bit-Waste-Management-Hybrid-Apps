# MadhavShah-Build-A-Bit-Waste-Management-Hybrid-Apps
We worked on the problem statement of company i.e. Urban Waste.
There will be two different applications for both urban people and garbage collectors.Both attach to the same database on AWS.
Application of user contains, Category,Date,Time ,amount, category of waste and picture of the waste. After filling this information only then they can submit and info will go to garbage collector, with clients name and his photo.


Garbage collector can login in his account, and can directly see the entries of his or her slots. He is also shown the most optimum route for the collection using the GOOGLE MAP API. 

In extra of this the app is an hybrid app i. e. can be used as an app or as an progressive web app. The app can also be easily used in all Android, IOS, Windows.
